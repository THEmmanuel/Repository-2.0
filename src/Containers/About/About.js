                    I love watching ideas flow and learning from and teaching other people things. I believe that's the best way to foster quick personal and group development.

                    I have spent a lot of time trying to understand vanilla JavaScript so I should be able to learn and pick any JavaScript based framework and/or library up pretty fast.

                    When I'm not coding you can find me playing video games, losing myself in a book, making illustrations or writing short stories and poems.
